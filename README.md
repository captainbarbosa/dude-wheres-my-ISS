Do you like using the command line? Are you always trying to find out when the International Space Station will be flying over your head, but don't have the proper command line tool to do it? I understand your frustration, so I've created a nice little Ruby program that will help you achieve these very important goals.

###Usage Instructions:

Download this code and run `main.rb` on your local machine, making sure you have the gems `rest-client` and `json` installed.
